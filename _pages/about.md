I am Javad Kavian, an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran, where I have developed a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer engineering. Throughout my studies, I have enjoyed tackling challenging problems, learning new technologies, and exploring how mathematical principles can be applied to real-world applications. I am passionate about continuous learning and enjoy working on projects that allow me to combine creativity with analytical thinking. Outside of academics, I value collaboration, persistence, and curiosityâ€”qualities that drive me to keep improving and exploring new ideas.
